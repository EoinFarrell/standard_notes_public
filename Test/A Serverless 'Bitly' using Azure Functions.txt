* Azure Function App created
* Buying domain name through Azure, App service domains
  * If you delete within a few days, then you don't pay for it
  * Linked to go daddy, does full dns etc

* Starting with redirect function rather than shortener function

TableStorage used to keep list of urls that can be read from redirect function
  
But in Azure functions around redirects so he has to hardcode Azure Functions version to use
    * How does everyone manage this in prod, generally relying on a platform ?

Azure Advisor Group / Community - Can be joined rather than going through support - Talk to meetup hosts etc who may be in and may be able to help

Creating proxy that links to his Redirect function
    This allows this
        https://admsus.azurewebsites.net/abc
    to proxy to this
        https://admsus.azurewebsites.net/api/redirect?shortcode=abc

New function CreateShortcut
    Bug stopped him from creating tableStorawebpage ge link so he manually copy pasted bindings from Redirect function to CreateShortcut function

ETags used with the table storage to avoid concurrency issues in case two runs at the same time try add the same key

CORS blocked initial JS requests to the Function as CORS stops other URLs from calling the server methods
In Azure, go to CORS settings and set what websites are allowed to call it
    * In this case he just * so everything can call it

Azure storage for static website hosting
    * General Purpose V1 Stoarge accounts don't support static website hosting
    * Just set index document name and error document path
    * It just creates another blob container called $web which means you don't have to go to full blob url
    * Then creates a DNS CNAME record to point at the blob storage web url
        * Can't use root url as that is used by one of the functions, so he set it up on www. subdomain

Setup a timer trigger function just to keep his other functions awake as they will stop after 5 minutes 


Then setup another proxy function just to redirect Gets to admsus.org to www.admsus.org
